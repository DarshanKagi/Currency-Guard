## Project Description

The **Currency Guard** project addresses the coin shortage problem faced by bus conductors in India by creating an automated system that exchanges paper currency for coins. This system, built using Arduino and sensors, ensures the accurate verification of currency notes and automatic coin dispensation. The goal is to improve operational efficiency, reduce transaction delays, and enhance customer satisfaction in the public transportation system.

This project was developed as part of the "Engineering Exploration & Practice" course under the **Centre for Engineering Education and Research (CEER)** at CMR College of Engineering & Technology.

## Features

- Automated paper currency verification using UV LEDs and color sensors.
- Dispenses coins accurately based on the value of the input currency.
- User-friendly interface, operable with minimal knowledge.
- Promotes seamless currency exchange and reduces operational delays.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- Arduino Uno
- Servo Motor
- UV LEDs
- Color Sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## How to Install and Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DarshanKagi/CurrencyGuard
   ```
   
2. **Open the project in the Arduino IDE.**

3. **Upload the code (`ArduinoUnoCode.c`) to the Arduino Uno board.**

4. **Connect the hardware components (UV LED, color sensor, servo motor) to the Arduino as per the wiring diagram.**

5. **Run the Arduino, and the system will start verifying currency and dispensing coins.**

## How to Use the Project

1. Insert a paper currency note into the designated input slot.
2. The UV LED and color sensors will verify the authenticity of the note.
3. Based on the note's value, the servo motor will dispense the corresponding number of coins.
4. The system resets and is ready for the next transaction.
